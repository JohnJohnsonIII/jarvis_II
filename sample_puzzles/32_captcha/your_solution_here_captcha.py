# The file, data_32.txt, has a series of equations, one 
#      per line of the file.
# 
# The equations fall into four categories:
#     * addition
#     * subtraction
#     * multiplication
#     * division

# Within each category, you will find three types of equations using
#     both standard operators and/or text-based operators, as shown below:
# ADDITION:        x plus y       OR x + y OR sum of x and y
# SUBTRACTION:     x minus y      OR x - y OR difference between x and y
# MULTIPLICATION:  x times y      OR x * y OR product of x and y
# DIVISION:        x divided by y OR x / y OR division of x by y

# Read each line of the file, determine which category of 
#     mathematical equation you should perform and then calculate
#     the result for that line, rounded to two decimal places.
# Your answer is the sum of all the results.

# For example,if given the following equations, you would calculate
#     the results shown:

#     sum of 6 and 6                 # 12
#     4 * 4                          # 16
#     10 * 3                         # 30
#     8 + 5                          # 13 
#     7 times 2                      # 14
#     0 plus 2                       #  2
#     1 + 1                          #  2
#     8 * 2                          # 16
#     difference between 7 and 4     #  3
#     division of 7 by 4             #  1.75   # round to 2 decimal places

# Finally, sum all these to produce the answer, again, rounded to
#     two decimal places, if necessary: 109.75

# An additional file with just the sample equations given above is
#     also included as test_data_32.txt
