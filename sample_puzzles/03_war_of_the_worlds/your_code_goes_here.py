# DESCRIPTION:

# In this puzzle, you will be given a file (war_of_the_worlds.txt) that contains
#     the text of H. G. Wells' "War of the Worlds" (via Project Gutenberg).
#
# Below are five hash hexdigests and five integers in pairs.
#     Each of the hash hexdigests represents the hash of a specific line in the file. 
#     The integers refer to a specific word on that line

# int hexdigest

# Your task is to identify which five words are represented by the hash hexdigest
#     and integer pairs. Once you have the five words, print them to the 
#     screen on a single line with each term separated by a single space.

# NOTE: the hexdigests are calculated after all whitespace has been removed
#     from both ends of the text.
